first thing you need to edit the `manifest.json` file, in the name you should put the extension name that appears in your browser, in the description just put a description, and in the icons put the icons path "WebP" and "svg" are not supported!
after you finish the setup just load the extension in your browser localy ðŸ«¡<br>
it's only issue that the video will pause but you can resume it normaly it's not a big deal and you don't have to wait 5 seconds to resume it!
